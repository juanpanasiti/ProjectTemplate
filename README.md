# Base Project App
## Introduction
This will be an Android oriented base app with de most basic configurations and instalations to start many of common projets (like my toy apps).

Why 'Android oriented'? I have 2 big reasons for that, one of them is because I haven't got an iPhone to test, and the second one is because I haven't got a Mac.

The entire app is developed with TypeScript and trying to use good practices (and all will be English first, since I'm a Spanish Speaker, this will be a good practice to me).

And, of course, any suggestion is accepted.. you can email me to <juanpanasiti@gmail.com>.

## What I include in this template:
* React Navigation
    * Base instalation 
    * Stack Native Navigator 
    * Stack Navigator
